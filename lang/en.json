  "Tutorial2": "The collections can be distinguished by their gray background and the shadow they have around them.",
  "Tutorial3": "Here is an example of a typical tree structure sentence in Pictalk,",

  "Tutorial14": "Another interesting action is that of bookmarking. This action allows you to move a pictogram or a collection to the top of the page. Here's how it's done.",
  "Tutorial15": "A very useful feature is that of linked duplicates. Making a linked duplicate allows you to have the same collection or pictogram in several places. Note that, if you modify the collection or pictogram in one place it will be modified everywhere.",
  "Tutorial16": "You can make a distinct copy of a collection or pictogram and then paste it wherever you want. Note that, if you modify the copy the original will be unaffected and vice versa.",
  "Tutorial17": "When creating or modifying pictograms and collections, you have access to options that add more meaning to the images, such as negations, time and plural form.",
  "Tutorial18": "Pictalk can be used while being offline. If cloud indicator is green it means you are ready to go offline. Note that while offline you cannot use the actions menu.",

  "Tutorial22": "located in the navigation bar.",
  "Tutorial23": "With Pictalk you will be able to share and receive collections similarly to Google Drive. To make working with groups easier we added the possibility to create groups and share to all users in it. Let’s see how both of these features work in the videos below.",

  "HomeTitle1": "What is Pictalk ?",
  "HomeText1": "Pictalk is a free and open-source application that aims to offer a simple way of speaking to the non-verbal people.",
  "HomeTitle2": "How it works",
  "HomeText2": "Pictalk uses augmentative and alternative communication systems such as the ones provided by the ARASAAC non-profit organization, but also photos and converts them into out loud speech. Pictalk is made for individuals but also for families and community life because the collections can be shared across devices, users and user groups. Pictalk uses Text-To-Speech voices that are natively present on your device to pronounce the constructed sentences.",
  "HomeTitle3": "Why Pictalk ?",
  "HomeText3": "The adventure started back in 2019 with my studies of Telecommunication engineering. The idea to create a simple application to help my non-verbal little brother was an evidence. The first version of Pictalk appeared and I was awarded a price for it. When my other brother joined the engineering school, he wanted to be part of this heartfelt project. Now, we're a team of two yound developers behind Pictalk and we're as motivated as ever to make speech a fundamental right.",
