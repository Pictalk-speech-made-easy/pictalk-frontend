Pictalk is made for individuals but also for families and community life because the collections can be shared across devices, users and user groups. Pictalk uses Text-To-Speech voices that are natively present on your device to pronounce the constructed sentences.",
  "HomeTitle3": "Why Pictalk ?",
  "HomeText3": "The adventure started back in 2019 with my studies of Telecommunication engineering. The idea to create a simple application to help my non-verbal little brother was an evidence. The first version of Pictalk appeared and I was awarded a price for it. When my other brother joined the engineering school, he wanted to be part of this heartfelt project. Now, we're a team of two yound developers behind Pictalk and we're as motivated as ever to make speech a fundamental right.",
