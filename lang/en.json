    "HomeText1": "Pic'Talk is about empowering individuals lacking of speech capabilities by providing a free and easy way to transform pictograms or photos in loud sentences. It uses Augmentative and Alternative Systems of Communication such as the ARASAAC pictograms to overcome the difficulties of communication for people with disabilities. Pic'Talk is designed for individuals but also for schools or groups. Pictograms can be shared to multiple groups and users with ease. How do Pic'Talk works ? It's fairly simple, it uses the Text-To-Speech voices you have in your device to pronounce the sentences you assembled. Why do we spend most of our free time building Pic'Talk ? I, Alex, started, back in 2019, to think about making an application to help my little brother, Pablo, talk. Pablo is one of the happiest individials I know and loves to communicate but, as he is a down syndrome carrier, he has difficulties with the oral language. Thanks to time and tons of coffee, I managed to build a first version of Pic'Talk and was awarded a price for it. As my other brother, Adri, saw Pablo talk for his first time, he immediately wanted to contribute to the project. Now we are a team of two developpers behind Pic'Talk and are as motivated as ever to make Speech a fundamental right.",
