					<p class="is-size-5 notification">
						"Makaton is a unique <b>language programme</b> that uses symbols, signs and speech to enable people to <b>communicate</b>. It supports the development of essential communication skills such as attention and listening, comprehension, memory, recall and organisation of <b>language</b> and <b>expression</b>.
                        Being able to communicate is one of the most important skills we need in <b>life</b>. Almost everything we do involves communication; everyday tasks such as learning at school, asking for food and drink, sorting out problems, making friends and having fun. These all rely on our ability to communicate with each other.
                        With <b>Makaton</b>, signs are used, with speech, in spoken word order. This helps provide extra clues about what someone is saying. Using signs can <b>help people</b> who have no speech or whose speech is unclear. Using symbols can help people who have limited speech and those who cannot, or prefer not to sign..."
