# ➤ Pictalk

> PicTalk is all about
>  **pictograms** . It's purpose is to make the life of
>  **speech-disabled** persons
>  **easier**. My little brother, Pablo, has
>  the down syndrome. He **isn't able to speak** nor to
>  write. Luckily Pablo is into tablet and phones. Most
>  of the communication Pablo does comes from his device.
>  The greater part of the time he uses pictures of places
>  or **pictograms to express himself**. Currently there are
>  very limited apps that use pictograms to produce a
>  sentence out loud. These apps were rather **expensive or
>  not compatible** with almost all devices. So I decided,
>  with my limited knowledge of Web development to make an
>  app.
